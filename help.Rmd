## File upload for flux visualisation

The input table should contain the following columns:
#### Experimental design variables
* `treatment_fact1`: First experimental factor of the dataset, i.e. diversification treatment (mixed crop vs. mono crop)
* `treatment_fact2`: Second experimental factor of the dataset, i.e. fertilisation treatment (organic vs. mineral)
* `treatment_fact3`: Third experimental factor, if available, i.e. position of chambers within the plots (row vs. berm)	
* `block`: Using a block design, this can be specified here
* `sub_factor`: Any other sub factor of the experiment...
* `chamber.nr`: This is a factor that contains a label for each individual chamber to look at the fluxes from each chamber separatly, no matter of the treatments.

#### Flux data
* `linear.f0`: Linear least square regression estimate of the flux
* `robust.linear.f0`: A robust linear flux estimate (i.e. from `gasfluxes` of the package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gasfluxes/index.html) 
* `HMR.f0`: HMR estmate	dynamic.kappa.f0	https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HMR/index.html
* `dynamic.kappa.f0`: see https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200876
